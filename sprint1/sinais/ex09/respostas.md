In the event of the reception of a signal, such as the SIGINT signal generated by pressing the CTRL-C
key combination, the operating system sends a request to terminate the program. Upon receipt of the signal,
the default action for SIGINT is to terminate the program immediately. Therefore, pressing CTRL-C
terminates the infinite loop and interrupts the printing of the message.

# D

Pressing CTRL-\ sends a SIGQUIT signal to the running process. In this newly modified program,
the default behaviour for s SIGQUIT signal is to terminate the process and to also generate a core dump
file.

In this case, we don't have a specific signal handler defined for function SIGQUIT, so the default
behaviour is used.

# F

It printed: "I won’t let the process end with CTRL-C!"

# G

It printed: "I won’t let the process end by pressing CTRL-\"

# E

After the CTRL-Z, the status of the process was changed to stopped.
After executing the jobs command, I was able to see a list of jobs in the current shell, along with their
job numbers. The process had a job number of 1 and to terminate it, I only used the kill command along with
the job number after %.
